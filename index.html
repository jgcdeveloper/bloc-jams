<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- This is required to tell the browser the type of code to interpret. -->

<html> <!-- This is the wrapper for the whole HTML document, marks beginning and end of document -->
  
    <head> <!-- This designated header, which contains info, but is not rendered by the browser -->

        <!-- <meta> viewport tag that indicates how the browser should render the content of the page in the devices viewport. As viewport is a meta tag, it belongs here in the head. 

        Meta tags provide metedata about the document, and while it is not displayed, the machine can read it and act on it. You can use it to control dimension and scaling.
        
        The width property sets the width of the document to equal the width of the device viewing the page. Alternately, it could be set to a pixel value, or some other value. As the average person is used to scrolling vertically to read, but not horizontally, this gives the website a natural reading environment.

        The initial-scale=1 specifies that the page should open with a zoon level of 1, that is no zoom, and elements are rendered as the CSS dictates.

        <!--<link> tag will allow us to link to external documents, in this case to several external stylesheets. Order is important as if there is conflict, the document will automatically use the style from the bottom-most style sheet. Note that if you have two elements/class/id that the two css reference to, only the specific elements that are the same are overwritten (ie if you have two background-color), not the style for the whole element.

        Attributes are as follows:
        rel is used to specify relationship between this document and the linked one, "stylesheet" is used specifically to import a stylesheet, type is used to specify the IANA media type of the document (see iana.org), "text/css" specifies it is a CSS sheet written in standard text ASCII formatting
        href is the actual link, in this case two relative local links and two remote links

Many librarys and/or script files are minified for production. The regular librarys are usually available if you want to read the inner workings of the library. -->
