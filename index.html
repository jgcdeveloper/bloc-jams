        <!--<link> tag will allow us to link to external documents, in this case to several external stylesheets. Order is important as if there is conflict, the document will automatically use the style from the bottom-most style sheet. Note that if you have two elements/class/id that the two css reference to, only the specific elements that are the same are overwritten (ie if you have two background-color), not the style for the whole element.

        Attributes are as follows:
        rel is used to specify relationship between this document and the linked one.
        "stylesheet" is used specifically to import a stylesheet
        type is used to specify the IANA media type of the document (see iana.org).
        "text/css" specifies it is a CSS sheet written in standard text ASCII formatting
        href is the actual link, in this case two relative local links and two remote links
