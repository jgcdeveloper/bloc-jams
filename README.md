Bloc-Jams Discovery Project

This is the first learning project done for my Bloc.io Software Developer Course. 
In it, I will deal with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It is heavily guided by the course content on Bloc.io

I will be commenting a lot on the functionality of the code, as the purpose of this project is for learning.
I also hope it can act to organize things in my mind, and hopefully as a reference should I need it later.
